## UserLogin

## Project Overview

The **UserLogin** program is a simple Java-based application that simulates a basic user authentication system. It allows users to enter their username and password, checks if they are correct, and provides an option to reset the password if the login fails. This is a fundamental project for beginners learning Java, focusing on conditional statements and user input handling.

## Features

- **User Input:** The program uses the `Scanner` class to accept user input for the username and password.
- **Authentication:** The program checks if the entered username and password match predefined credentials.
- **Password Reset:** If the login fails, users are prompted to reset their password. The new password must be different from the old one.
- **Validation:** The program ensures that the new password is not the same as the old one, enhancing security.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the key components in the code:

- **Variable Declarations:** `userName`, `password`, `resetChoice`, and `newPassword` store user inputs and choices.
- **Login Validation:** The program checks if the entered username and password match the predefined credentials ("admin" and "123").
- **Password Reset Option:** If the login fails, the program asks the user if they want to reset their password. If they choose to reset, they must enter a new password that is different from the old one.
- **Output:** Depending on the inputs, the program outputs messages indicating whether the login was successful, the password was reset, or if there was an error.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the program might work:

```bash
Enter your username: admin
Enter your password: 123
Login Successful
```
